Ate: Welcome back! You're doing great. Now, let's level up your batchoy game.

Ate: My friend gave me this old cooler filled with bottled water. It's a great way to add a refreshing touch to your batchoy.

Ate: Bihon noodles are another popular choice for batchoy. They are thin and delicate, offering a different texture compared to miki noodles.

Ate: Now, let's see if you can create a delicious batchoy with these new ingredients. Remember, the key is balance and experimentation. Have fun!
