Ate: Welcome back! Let's start by reviewing the basics.

Ate: The broth is the heart of our batchoy. It's made with a secret family recipe, simmered for hours to bring out the best flavors.

Ate: Miki noodles are a classic choice for batchoy. They have a chewy texture and absorb the broth perfectly.

Ate: This is pork liver, a popular topping for batchoy. It adds a unique texture and a slightly gamey flavor.

Ate: And finally, we have pork, a staple in Filipino cuisine. It's tender and juicy, complementing the other ingredients perfectly.

Ate: Now, here's the twist: some customers may have preferences or dietary restrictions. 

Ate: So, be prepared to customize your batchoy to their liking. For example, some customers may not want liver, while others may prefer a lighter broth.

Ate: Let's see if you can create the perfect batchoy for every customer, no matter their preferences. Flexibility is key in the world of food service!
