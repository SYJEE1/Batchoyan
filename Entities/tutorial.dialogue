Ate: Welcome to my batchoy business! I'm so excited to share my delicious creations with you. Let's start with the basics.

Ate: This is the heart of our batchoy, the rich and flavorful broth. It's made with a secret family recipe, simmered for hours to bring out the best flavors.

Ate: These are miki noodles, a classic choice for batchoy. They have a chewy texture and absorb the broth perfectly.

Ate: This is pork liver, a popular topping for batchoy. It adds a unique texture and a slightly gamey flavor.

Ate: And finally, we have pork, a staple in Filipino cuisine. It's tender and juicy, complementing the other ingredients perfectly.

Ate: Now, let's see if you can create the perfect bowl of batchoy!

Ate: My lola taught me everything I know about batchoy. She always said, "The secret to a great batchoy is love and passion." Let's see if you can capture that magic in your creations.
